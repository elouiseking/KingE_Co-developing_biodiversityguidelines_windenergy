Management,Manage in a positive way for native species,All,Bats,Feather the turbine blades,The turbine blades are pitched at 90 degrees or parallel to the wind to reduce their rotation speed while idling to below two revolutions per minute. ,"NIEA - Guidance on Bat Surveys, Assessment & Mitigation for Onshore Wind Turbine Developments",https://cieem.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NIEA-Guidance-on-Bat-Surveys-for-Wind-Turbine-Proposals-Final-August-1....pdf
Management,Manage in a positive way for native species,All,Bats,Curtail the turbines,"Curtailment involves raising the cut-in speed of wind turbines and feathering the blades to reducetheir operation during periods of high bat activity. Curtailment can be applied as a blanket aproach during certain times of the year when bats are most active (usually April to October) or it can be linked to real time data, e.g., temperature and wind speed, gathered on site and programmed using the SCADA operating system of wind turbines.

Management,Manage in a positive way for native species,All,Bats,Use post-construction monitoring,Post construction monitoring should be carried out on all sites where a curtailment regime has been implemented. Where post construction monitoring is recommended it should be detailed in a Bat Monitoring and Mitigation Plan (BMMP) which should be submitted for assessment and agreed before any planning approval is granted. Post construction monitoring should last for a period of 3-5 years depending on the risk level of the site but should also be subject to review.,"NIEA - Guidance on Bat Surveys, Assessment & Mitigation for Onshore Wind Turbine Developments",https://cieem.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NIEA-Guidance-on-Bat-Surveys-for-Wind-Turbine-Proposals-Final-August-1....pdf
Restoration,Restore and rehabilitate peatland habitats,Peatland,All,Convert commercial forest on peat soils to bog,"Remove trees by enhanced felling (removing the whole tree). Brash removal is then conducted to limit nutrient input. Reprofile the site, most commonly done by 'cross track' - where a low pressure trached vehicle(s) is driven over the ridges to flatten them into furrows. Tree stumps will also need to be delt with - stump flipping is commonly used on former Sitka spruce plantations on deeper peat deposits, where an excavator is used to flip the stump and root plate out of the ridge and into the furrow. On shallower peats and former lodgepole pine plantations stump auguring can be used, which drills the stump into smaller pieces.
